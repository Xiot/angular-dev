Ideas
---------------------------
create directive for async commands
 - use angular-promise-tracker (maybe overkill) to watch for when the promise is complete
  - allow for animations when the promise resolves
  use case:
	expanding menu item, where getting the sub menus needs to happen async
	  - show a loading animation while retreiving data

incorporate ui-utils.format or similar for easy string formatting

easy attribute based validation (see ui-utils-validation)
service based validators (sync and async)
